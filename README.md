# Stencil Generator

Turns your finished digital tattoo artwork into a print-ready stencil, entirely in the browser (no server, no account, no per-use cost, nothing uploaded anywhere).

## Running locally

Any static file server works — ES modules and Web Workers require `http://`, not `file://`. Double-click `Start Stencil Generator.cmd` (Windows), or run:

```
npx serve .
# or
python -m http.server 8000
```

Then open the printed URL.

## Deploying to GitHub Pages

1. Push this folder's contents to a repo (or to a `stencil_generator/` path if kept alongside other projects). This includes `models/informative-drawings.onnx` (~17MB) — GitHub Pages serves it like any other static file.
2. In the repo's Settings → Pages, set the source to the branch/folder containing `index.html`.
3. No build step is required — it's plain HTML/CSS/JS.
4. **Cache-busting:** GitHub Pages gives every file `Cache-Control: max-age=600` and there's no way to change that, so a stale `js`/`css` file can be served (from GitHub's edge cache or a visitor's browser) for up to 10 minutes after a deploy. Whenever a deploy touches `js/` or `css/`, bump the `?v=N` in these three spots together before pushing:
   - `index.html` — the `<link>` and `<script>` tags
   - `js/main.js` — the `./pipeline.js?v=` and `./png.js?v=` imports and the `ASSET_VERSION` constant (this one alone threads through to `worker.js` and its own `pipeline.js` import)

## How it works

- **Line art comes from a real neural network, not an edge filter.** A classical filter (Sobel/Canny/XDoG) can only ever find "every edge in the pixels" — it has no way to know which lines an artist would actually keep. `models/informative-drawings.onnx` is a network trained specifically to convert a photo/illustration into line-art, so it produces selective, confident linework much closer to a hand-drawn stencil.
- `js/worker.js` — runs entirely off the main thread: loads the ONNX model (via `onnxruntime-web`, WASM backend), runs inference once per uploaded image, and caches the result so slider tweaks never re-run the network.
- `js/pipeline.js` — pure post-processing math (levels cleanup and line thickness, posterize, stencil-over-reference colour tinting). Operates on the network's output and on the original artwork; no DOM access, so it's reusable and easy to test outside the browser.
- `js/png.js` — small PNG encoder for downloads: writes the chosen DPI into every file, and saves the stencil as a true 1-bit black/white PNG.
- `js/main.js` — UI wiring: upload, two-phase preview (one-time "analyze" pass + instant slider-driven "finalize" pass), preview modes (Original / Stencil / Stencil + Ref / Split), layer toggle, stencil colour picker, export.

**Two-phase preview:** uploading a photo triggers one network inference pass (a second or two) at a capped working resolution. Every slider after that — Keep Detail, Background Cleanup, Line Thickness, Crisp, Invert, reference tone bands, stencil colour, reference opacity — is cheap post-processing on the cached network output, so the preview stays responsive on mobile despite the heavier underlying model.

**Export resolution:** the network runs at a capped analysis resolution (quality plateaus above this, and it keeps export time reasonable on mobile). The default **Stencil (Smooth & Crisp)** line style then renders natively at your print size (width + DPI, default 203 DPI for thermal stencil printers): the network's *soft* output is enlarged first and only then cut to pure black/white, with stroke-relative thresholding and hysteresis so faint strokes stay continuous, then specks removed and pinholes filled. Thresholding before enlarging (the older styles) is what makes edges jagged and grey. The preview renders at the same pixel scale as the export, so what you see is what you download.

**Three exports:**
- *Stencil* — binary/high-contrast line art, for a thermal stencil printer.
- *Grayscale Reference* — continuous-tone grayscale copy, for a regular printer with a grey ink tank, to use as a shading reference alongside the stencil.
- *Stencil + Reference (Colour)* — the line art tinted in a chosen colour and layered on top of the grayscale reference, so both are visible in one image.

## Why this beats a generic AI image prompt

ChatGPT/Gemini-style image generation *regenerates* the image through a diffusion model — for realism/portrait tattoo work that means hallucinated details and an inaccurate likeness. This tool instead runs a purpose-built line-extraction network directly on your actual artwork (image-to-image, not generative), so the output stays faithful to your composition, and every stage after that (detail level, cleanup, line thickness) is manually tunable rather than a black box.

## Model credit & license

`models/informative-drawings.onnx` is the ONNX export (by [Joseph Rocca](https://github.com/josephrocca/image-to-line-art-js)) of **Informative Drawings** by Caroline Chan et al. ("Learning to Generate Line Drawings that Convey Geometry and Semantics", CVPR 2022) — [original repo](https://github.com/carolineec/informative-drawings), MIT licensed. `onnxruntime-web` (Microsoft, MIT licensed) is loaded from jsDelivr at runtime to run it.

## Known limitations

- Best results are on clean digital artwork (the intended input); real skin/tattoo photos are noisier and need more slider tuning (Background Cleanup / Keep Detail especially).
- The network won't reproduce hand-drawn conventions like solid-vs-dashed-vs-dotted line semantics — that judgment call still belongs to you. This tool gets you a strong, editable starting point, not a finished stencil.
